Choosing. It's not time, it's (usually) not resources. It's not unfairness because of either time or resources either.
Why is choosing an issue?
- Especially if you're a beginner, you don't know what hasn't been done

The traits you want to have
- You may not be able to choose what you want, but if you can affect it by means of wanting to want something, you should want to be obsessive.

The choice
- Evaluate the processes in your life critically. There is technology that could improve most of the things you do - which things could you improve with the technology you would like to learn about and use?
    - This favors "D2C"-like projects, which we (as consumers) gravitate toward
- The best projects will be open-ended problem-solving. Their value as expository tools is directly proportional to problem-solving skill demonstrated, which in turn is inversely related to how common the solution to the problem is
    - What opportunities exist to do open-ended problem-solving?
        - Evaluating the improvement opportunities in your daily life
        - Being exposed to other people's problems
    - It's harder to be exposed to other people's problems, but it's more valuable
- Problems can easily be too big for one person to tackle, even with modest-capability reasoning search engines, so how do you know how much is too much?
    - What actual heuristic can you develop to estimate how long you'd be able to complete a project in a reasonable timeframe?
    - For instance, for a 3-month project to which you can dedicate 15 hours a week - that's more or less 195 hours, which is enough time to complete quite a few projects.
    - How much work can you accomplish in 195 hours? It depends on your level of proficiency, and only you will reasonably be able to estimate it. It helps if you track time use, since you can then compare past experience to expectation.
    - Reading the whole of Patterson and Hennessy while doing half its exercises took me 138 hours. That left 30% of the allocated time free. That's 138 hours for a 1000-odd page book (granted, without most of the bonus sections or half the exercises).
- What if the problem is not *finding* an appropriate project, but choosing between multiple?
    - This is not an issue with projects that are in the same problem/subject domain, but one if you're undecided on what problem domain you'd like to tackle
    - If you have multiple problem domains under consideration, consider mapping out their intersection. A project in that intersection would likely be more fun for you *and* provide more value to the world, since projects leveraging 2 or more disparate skillsets are much rarer.
    - Example: Do you want to learn more about ML infrastructure, which is mostly in Python/C++/CUDA, but also want to learn Rust? You could port a tool that exists in the traditional ML ecosystem to Rust.
    - Example 2: Do you want to learn about robotics and about AI engineering? Program a simple robot to take simple actions based on language input.

The process
- Don't use a complete (end-to-end) reference example for your projects - you may use the final result as a reference, but not the whole process.
    - Any individual process you may want to learn about can be treated as the final result of a particular learning project.
    - Particular solutions to finnicky problems can be fine, but ideally you arrived at the problem yourself, instead of being shown it exists.
- How to prevent boredom? Convince yourself that you care
    - Presumably you started the side project because you believed there was value to be gained from executing and maybe even finishing it.
