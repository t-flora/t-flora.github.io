Angle: if you could decide what to remember, what price would you pay in time spent?
Methodology doesn't matter - you have the capability, how do you evaluate the decision?

Dependency: what's recall good for?
- Action: Accomplishing goals by recalling actions that help in achieving them
- Transfer: Recalling useful information in new contexts - depends on forming and then recalling abstractions on transfer knowledge
- As an end in itself: This is what schools test for

What about discovery?
- What is discovery?
    - Having novel realizations or insights
    - Novel realizations can be combinations of existing ideas (e.g. genetic algorithms) or the discovery of entirely new mechanisms (e.g. evolution)
- Discovery might depend on a nonlinear combination of recalled information coupled with new information

Possible topics to discuss:
- Heuristics for estimating expected value of committing a piece of information to memory
- What types of information will you forget but have expected value ($>0$)
    - Actually, you need information that gives at least risk-free returns - in terms of "guaranteed satisfaction in remembering"
    - How do you estimate this return? You take the amount of time expected to remember something, at least in an OOM, and you divide it by the expected lifetime added search and recall time of the concept
    - This also works well with a corpus of knowledge - getting familiarized with a whole subject for a second time is quite frustrating if you need to recall from the basics
- Take a knowledge-graph view of what you know to estimate the returns to remembering something
    - How? If the node is central, you'll likely reuse many times anyway - if the node is a leaf, it may not be justified in the amount of time it takes to remember
    - What about impact? What's the value of memorizing a particular PyTorch method that you'll use again and again and again? It's should be a leaf in terms of dependencies, but not in terms of impact, since many *uses* of that method will be made to achieve different goals
- It seems like you can mostly separate recall value for goal achievement and for discovery
    - Discovery might be your goal, but that doesn't make its ideal use of memory the same as, say, becoming good at building applications

## Memory systems are demanding
